        <h1>What we do</h1>

        <p>
        We offer a short online loan request form for you to fill 
        out at your leisure. With our secure form submission process,
         we make it simple for you to get your information in front of our 
         large network of lenders and other third-party lender networks in our 
         network. Once you submit the form on our site, we immediately go to
          work presenting your information to these lenders to give them a chance
           to offer you a loan.
       If a lender choosed to offer you a loan, then we redirect you to the lender or 
       lending partner’s offer page containing the details of the loan for you to review.
        They may also reach out to you by email, phone, and/or text. You may have to fill 
        out some additional information once you get to your lender’s website so please 
        follow the instructions carefully. If you are approved for the loan and accept 
        the terms of the loan, then your funds may be deposited directly into your checking
         account as soon as the next business day.
       If no lending partner offers you a loan, we may show you ads for other lenders
        or connect you with offers for debt relief, credit repair, or other 
        credit-related services. Don’t worry, we don’t show these other companies the sensitive information in your loan request. We only give them your contact information so they can contact you. You are under no obligation to accept their offers and you should carefully review their offers to you and compare them to other options available to you before accepting.
