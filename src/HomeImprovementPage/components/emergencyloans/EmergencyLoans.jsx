         <h3>Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)</h3>
        <p>
    
        A HELOC is a loan that uses your home as collateral
         and allows you to borrow up to the total amount of
          equity you currently have in your home. This is a
           popular option because you have a designated window
            of time to use it as a line of credit, adding to the 
            total as needed. During that same time period, you can 
            opt to pay only the accrued interest each month. The downsides
             are that the interest rate may change and even go up, and
              using your home as collateral can be risky if you are 
              unable to make the payments.
