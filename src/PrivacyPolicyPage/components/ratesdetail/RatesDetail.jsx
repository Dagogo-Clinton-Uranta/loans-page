         <h3>Repayment</h3>
        <p>
    
        Repayment on personal loans is generally performed either monthly
         or once every two weeks, depending either on your preferences
          or your lender's or lending partner’s terms. You may be able
           to have funds withdrawn automatically from your bank account
            on the date agreed upon with your lender or lending partner.
             Be sure that you read and fully understand all policies regarding 
             repayment and understand what you will have to do as a borrower to
              repay the loan. Your loan cannot be conditioned upon repayment by 
              electronic funds transfer or automatic withdrawal. Consult your lender
               or lending partner for more details.
        </p>


        <h3>Personal Loan Costs</h3>
        <p>
    
        On the whole, the eventual cost of a personal loan will 
        vary a great deal based on factors related to the requester,
         the state the requester lives in, the lender or lending 
         partner, and the requester's repayment. Other factors that 
         matter are the amount of money that is borrowed, the period
          of time of the loan and the specific interest rates used. 
          Your credit score may also be taken into consideration.
        </p>
