        <h1>Personal Loan Requirements</h1>

        <p>
        Although we will accept loan requestors with any credit score,
         there are still a few basic requirements that the lenders
          in our network are looking for. Before you request a loan,
           make sure you meet specific criteria regarding these items. 
           Please note that meeting these requirements does not mean
            that you will be connected to a lender.
 <ul>         
<li>Age/ID/Residency Status - You must be 18 or older to be eligible for 
a personal loan. You must also have a valid Social Security number,
 and be a legal U.S. citizen or permanent resident.
 </li>
<li>
Income - In order to ensure that you will be able to repay a loan,
 you must either have full-time employment, be self-employed, or receive
  regular disability or Social Security benefits. Some lenders or 
  lending partners may require a pay stub or other form of income 
  verification.
  </li>
  
  <li>
Bank Account - Most loans require a valid checking account, as 
once a loan is approved for you through poorcreditquickloans.com, your lender
 or lending partner will deposit your funds directly into said account.

 </li>

 <li>
 Credit Type - Although it is always better to have good credit, you do 
not necessarily need to have a good or excellent credit record to qualify
 for a personal loan. Having good or excellent credit might cause a lender 
 to provide you more favorable terms.Most lenders require that customers 
 demonstrate a pattern of responsibility. To be eligible for a personal loan
  product, typically an individual must not have any accounts more than 60 days
   late; must not have active or recent bankruptcies; must not exhibit a pattern 
   of late payments; must not have any debt that cannot be covered by current income; 
   and must not have any recently charged-off accounts. We are not a lender, and do not
    make any lending decisions. Only a lender can decide if they choose to extend a credit
     or loan offer to you.
 </li>

 </ul>  

 
Meeting these requirements does not necessarily guarantee you will be approved for a personal loan,
 but it does significantly boost the chances that approval will occur.
