      Companies like ours need to share users’ personal information to run their 
      everyday business. When we disclose personal information for a business purpose,
       we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to keep 
       that personal information confidential. In the sections below, we list the reasons
        we use and share users’ personal information and whether you can limit this sharing.
