        There are a certain set of requirements to submit a request for fast cash loans that most lenders adhere to. For your quick reference, weâ€™ve listed some of them below:

        <br />
<ul>
  
  <li>You must be at least 18 years old</li>
  <li>You must have an active bank account where you would like the funds deposited</li>
  <li>You must have proof of income and in some cases, make more than $500 a month</li>
</ul>


These requirements are bound to vary from lender to lender. For example, some lenders require a certain minimum credit score. Others might ask for copies of your bank statements for the last three months. These requirements are in place to help the lender determine how likely you are to repay the loan within the designated installment term.
