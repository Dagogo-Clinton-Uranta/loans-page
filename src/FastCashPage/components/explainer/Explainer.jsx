        Need a loan with bad credit? You can get a co-signer. The fact of the matter is that loans for people with bad credit usually come with costly terms–a high interest rate being one of them. Your credit score will directly impact the interest rate of your loan, which will determine how much extra you’ll end up paying for the money you borrowed.
        <br/><br/>
     When you enlist the help of a co-signer, the interest rate will be calculated according to the co-signer’s credit score. So, if you know someone with a great score and they’re in a position to help you get a loan, it doesn’t hurt to ask.
     <strong>Even so much as a 40-point difference in a score can save you hundreds of dollars</strong>, depending on the amount borrowed and the terms agreed upon. Here’s a quick example using typical APRs according to credit scores.
       
       <br/><br/>
     Let’s say you have a poor credit score of 635 and you apply for a small bad credit loan of $5k. In our hypothetical example, this loan comes with an interest rate of 29%. That means that you have to pay back the loan in full, plus 29% of the total amount borrowed—which is a whopping $1,450 for a grand total of $6,450.
       Now let’s reimagine the scenario with a cosigner who has an average credit score of 645 (just 10 points higher than yours). You are approved for the loan of $5k with an interest rate of 19%, which brings your grand total to $5,950.<br/>
       By seeking the help of a cosigner with a credit score just barely higher than yours, you could potentially save $500 in interest—and the savings increase the higher the credit score goes.
