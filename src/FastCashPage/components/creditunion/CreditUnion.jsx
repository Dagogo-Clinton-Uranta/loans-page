      <h2>Join a credit Union</h2>
       <p>
       Joining a credit union is another great way to avoid the pain points of securing small loans for bad credit. At a traditional bank or lending office, loans for people with bad credit are usually based off of the applicantâ€™s credit score. Credit unions do things a little differently.
      When you are a member of a credit union and you apply for a loan, the review process takes into account several different factors, not just your score. Credit unions may consider your length of employment, your debt-to-income ratio, and other components of your overall financial health.
