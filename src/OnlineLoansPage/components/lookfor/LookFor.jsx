         <h2>What to Look For</h2>
        <p>
        Anytime you share personal or financial information online, 
        you want to be sure it is with a company you trust. Be aware
         of the way a personal online loan should work and watch for 
         warning signs that may indicate a scam. Companies that offer
          very short-term loans may expect you to be unable to pay the
           loan off in this amount of time, which means they get to collect
            more fees. They may also charge considerably higher interest rates 
            than other online loan companies. We recommend that you do not agree
             to an upfront payment of any kind, as this may be indicative of a scam.
       You should also be leery of companies who promise to help you acquire online loans
        with no credit check. While this may seem enticing if your credit score is low,
            you may be getting in over your head. A credit check is a good way to ensure you
           are getting a loan that you can afford.
