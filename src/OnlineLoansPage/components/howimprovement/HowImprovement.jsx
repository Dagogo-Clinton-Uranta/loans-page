         <h3>Personal Installment Loans</h3>
        <p>
        Personal online installment loans are a great option
         because they are fast and convenient. They are also 
         customizable to your personal financial needs. 
         Regulations for personal installment loans vary
          by state, but the basic requirements are similar.
           You generally need to have a credit score above 
           580, an income above $2,000 per month, and be 
           employed, self-employed, or receiving benefits.
            You can request a loan amount of between $1,000 
            and $3,500. The amount of your loan, interest rate,
             and length of the loan will be determined by the 
             lender based on your qualifications.
        </p>

        <h3>Peer-to-Peer Loans</h3>
        <p>
    
        When applying for home improvement loans,
         you will need to submit your credit score,
          your debt-to-income ratio, the amount of 
          money you are requesting, and your basic 
          personal information like social security 
          number and employment history. You do not 
          necessarily need to have good credit to obtain
           a loan; however, a better score can increase
            the likelihood of approval and can affect 
            the interest rate.
           Nowadays, you can do most everything online,
           including submitting a request for a home improvement
            loan. It can be smart to shop around and compare rates
             before choosing the lender you want to stick with.
              You can save time doing research by going with a 
              company like poorcreditquickloans.com. We use your information 
              to connect you with one of our lending partners who has 
              an offer that can work for you. Once you have been connected
               and approved, the lender can complete the loan process quickly and get you the funding you need for your home improvement project.
