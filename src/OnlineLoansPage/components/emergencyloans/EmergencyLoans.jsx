         <h3>What Are Online Loans?</h3>
        <p>
    
        An online loan is similar to a traditional loan, except that everything 
        is done over the internet. As long as you have a connection to the internet,
         you can fill out a loan request. There are many different types of online
          loans, as well as online lenders.
