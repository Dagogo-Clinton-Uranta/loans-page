         <h3>Payday Loans Are Small</h3>
        <p>
        Payday loans come with fees and interest
         rates that can add a lot more to the amount 
         you will be required to pay back to the lender.
          The average cost of a payday loan is between $10 
          and $30 for every $100 borrowed. So, for example,
           if you were borrowing $500 with a typical
            lender’s fee of $20, the total amount you could
             expect to repay could be between $570 and $670.

        <h3>Payday Loans Cost Money</h3>
        <p>
        Payday loans come with fees and interest rates
         that can add a lot more to the amount you will
          be required to pay back to the lender. The average
           cost of a payday loan is between $10 and $30 for 
           every $100 borrowed. So, for example, if you were 
           borrowing $500 with a typical lender’s fee of $20, 
           the total amount you could expect to repay could be
            between $570 and $670.

        <h3>Loan Terms Are Short</h3>
        <p>
    
        The short loan term length is a defining 
        characteristic of a payday loan. These short-term
         loans are usually required to be repaid within
          two to four weeks, usually around your next pay 
          day. These small loans are intended to provide
           you with the money you need only until you receive 
           your next paycheck.
        </p>


        <h3>It All Depends On Where You Live</h3>
        <p>
    
        Because of the high interest rates and rigid repayment 
        terms, many states enforce caps on fees, interest rates,
         and loan sizes. You’ll find that the conditions may 
         vary depending on where you live, so it’s wise to do 
         your research before submitting a request.
        Georgia currently prohibits payday loans altogether, 
        while other states such as New York and New Jersey 
        limit payday loan interest rates to 25-30%. More than half of the United States authorizes high-cost payday lending.
