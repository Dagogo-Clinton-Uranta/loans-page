         <h3>Get Emergency Loan Help</h3>
        <p>
    
        We all hope we’ll never find ourselves in an emergency situation
         that requires money we don’t have on hand. Unfortunately, these
          incidents are quite common. Car repairs, medical bills, and 
          unemployment sneak up on the best of us, and if we don’t have
           enough money in our savings accounts, we need to know what our
            options are. One way to handle unexpected expenses like these
             is with emergency loans.

        <h3>Payday Loans</h3>
        <p>
    
        A payday loan is a loan that needs to be paid off when you 
        receive your next paycheck. This type of loan can be useful
         if you know you will be able to pay it off right away without
          going further into debt.
        </p>


        <h3>Short-Term Loans</h3>
        <p>
    
        The length of a short-term loan varies, usually between 30
         and 60 days, giving you a little more time for repayment
          than a payday loan. You can still receive the funds quickly 
          and the terms can be more favorable to help you pay off the
           loan quickly. This type of loan can be a great option if 
           you know you will be receiving a bonus or tax return soon
            and can use that to pay it off. It is also great for emergency
             bills small enough for you to take a little out of a few
              consecutive paychecks to cover the cost.
