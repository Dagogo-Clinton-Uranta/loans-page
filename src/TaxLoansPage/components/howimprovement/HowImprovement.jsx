         <h3>How Do You Qualify for a Tax Advance?</h3>
        <p>
        Wondering how to qualify for a tax advance yourself? 
        You’ll be eligible if you expect to receive a refund
         from the IRS in the year you want the income loan.
          You may be required to borrow a minimum amount,
           such as $100-$500.
        </p>

        <h3>When Do You Get the Tax Loan?</h3>
        <p>
    
        Once you’ve requested a tax advance loan,
         you might get your funds as soon as the next
          business day after your request is processed.
           This is an appealing turnaround time for many
            people since it can often take 21 days or more
             for the IRS to issue tax returns.
        </p>


        <h3>Does It Cost Money to Get a Tax Advance?</h3>
        <p>
    
        The cost of getting a tax advance depends on 
        the lender and the person paying the loan. 
        Some lenders will give you the loan without
         charging any fees or interest, but they may 
         charge you to process the loan. Other lenders 
         might offer the tax advance as an incentive for
          filing your taxes with their company. This money 
          can be paid out of pocket or be taken as a cut 
          from your tax refund totals.
         The tax refund loan will also cost you money if
          you don’t pay the loan back on time or are charged
           an interest rate. Carefully consider the terms of
           the loan to know what the tax advance may cost you
            over time.
        </p>

        <h3>How Does a Tax Refund Loan Affect Your Credit Score?</h3>
        <p>
    
        As with many loans, your lender will need to check your
         credit score before granting the loan. This allows
          them greater assurance that you’ll be able to pay off 
          the loan on time. Some lenders make a hard inquiry on 
          your credit, which could briefly lower your credit score. 
          Other lenders will only review or make a soft inquiry, 
          which will not affect your credit score.
        </p>

        <h3>What If Your Tax Refund Is Less Than Your Loan Amount?</h3>
        <p>
    
        Because the tax refund loan is issued before the 
        IRS actually processes your tax return, the money 
        you get back may differ slightly from the amount
         of money you’re issued with your tax refund loan.
        This may happen if the IRS declines one of the deductions 
        you claimed, or if there was some other miscalculation in 
        your taxes. Your tax return might also be less if you have 
        overdue child support, overdue tax debt, or student loan debt,
         or if you’re subject to a slew of other circumstances affecting your return.
        Whether your tax return is smaller, bigger, or the same amount as 
        the loan you receive, you’ll usually still have to pay off the loan in full. Some lenders may make an exception and forgive the difference, but you’ll need to check with the specific lender in advance.
